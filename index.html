          <li>Arrays are useful tools for storing multiple items with different data types in a single variable, but not all arrays must have multiple data types.</li>

          <li>A "for" loop contains the following three important statements:  the starting point for our loop ("let x = 0"), the condition ("x < shapes.length"), and what allows the array to iterate over each item ("x+1 or x++")</li>
